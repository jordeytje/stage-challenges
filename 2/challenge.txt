"FIZZ BUZZ"

# Description
Players generally sit in a circle.
The first player says the number “1”, and each player says next number in turn.
However, any number divisible by X (for example, three) is replaced by the word fizz, and any divisible by Y (for example, five) by the word buzz.
Numbers divisible by both become fizz buzz. A player who hesitates, or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.

Write a program that prints out the final series of numbers where those divisible by X, Y and both are replaced by “F” for fizz, “B” for buzz and “FB” for fizz buzz.

# Example
Input:
3 5

Output:
1 2 F 4 B 7 8 F B


# How do I do it?
- Write a function which loops from 1 to 100 and accepts 2 parameters (Fizz & Buzz)
- Output the loop from 1 to 100 where the given parameters are correctly replaced with the words (or first letter of): Fizz or Buzz.
