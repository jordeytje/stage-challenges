"TRICK OR TREAT"

# Description
Everyone knows what Halloween is and how children love it.
Children in costumes travel from house to house asking for treats with a phrase "Trick or treat".

After that, they divide the treats equally among all. This year, they collected tons of candies, and need your help to share everything equally.

You know that children receive different number of candies depending on their costume: vampire gets 3 candies from one house, zombie – 4 candies, and witch – 5 candies.
That is, three children in three different costumes get 3+4+5=12 candies from one house.

So:
Vampire: 3 candies per house
Zombie: 4 candies per house
Witch: 5 candies per house
